        <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold orbitron mb-6">Rocket Science Made Simple: Explaining the Basics of Rocket Propulsion</h2>
        <p class="text-lg roboto-condensed">
          Rocket propulsion is quite a complex subject, but its very basics need to be understood for space travel. The most basic concept behind rocket propulsion is to achieve thrust by overcoming the pull of gravity and launching the vehicle upwards in space. This occurs by controlled ignition of fuel inside the engine, due to which it produces a very high-pressure force that is exerted through a nozzle. First, there are liquid, solid, and hybrid engines. Treynex uses the hybrid engine in their ALS-1-an appropriate blend of advantages from both liquid and solid propellants for an efficient and powerful propulsion system. Propellants like LOX and ethanol provide the needed energy for launching, ensuring the rocket can reach its target altitude and trajectory. Simplifying intricate concepts in rocket science, Treynex desires to make space explorations more understandable and accessible to the public as a whole.
